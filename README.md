# ocr-example-with-tesseract-in-java-and-eclipse
This repo shows the simple example of organizing tesseract libraries to get along in eclipse with a simple example.

pull the project or clone it as this is a ready to use example.

Instructions for usage :

-1: open the project in eclipse.

-2: Under Run -Run configurations Select the Main -  Arguements and give the actual path of your image file(Right now
it doesnt recognise handwritten text images but sure I will add it in some time), and click apply and run.

-3: you can also generate a jar file of the project easily for distribution but make sure you place the tessdata folder 
and the jar at same place else it will throw and error.

Note: The accuracy may varry with blurred or certain other images like mathematical formulas right now.
